		-“Bunuelos” at the top of the page with the red background is awkwardly placed too close to the top edge of the red bar. <br>
-Line height should be increased so there is more space to read easily on mobile.<br>
-There should be more spaces in-between the instruction steps so its easier to distinguish each step from each other.<br>
-Your ingredients list are check boxes on mobile which is slightly confusing, may be better just as bullet points.<br>
⁃You may want to include more images that show the process of cooking Bunuelos.<br>
⁃White text on a red background is interesting but slightly difficult to read. You may want to experiment with using a white background and incorporating the red more subtly.<br>
