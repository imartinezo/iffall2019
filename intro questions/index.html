			<li>I am originally from Colombia, and have always been interested in art. I wanted to take this class because so far everything I have done is meant for print. In order to be well-rounded, I wanted to learn how to work for just screens.</li>
			<li>I have no experience in HTML/CSS/JS.</li>
			<li>I hope to learn how to be comfortable coding, and how to design for screens.</li>
			<li>It is different in the sense that you immediately see what you get. In printing you have to imagine what it is going to look like, and will not look the same way once you print it.</li>
			<li>https://www.buzzfeed.com/ The buzzfeed website exemplifies effective design in the way they organize their thumbnails. It is an extrememely user friendly website, and takes the user a second to find what they are looking for. </li>
			<li>https://www.ogilvy.com/ The Ogilvy home website exemplifies effective communication in that it gives a clear idea of what the company is about the minute you go to their homepage. By using images, Ogilvy is effective in telling the viewer that they are a branding agency.</li>
			<li>https://www.nytimes.com/ The New York Times website works well by organizing everything in a way that the viewer first sees the most important stories first. It also is broken up into tabs with specific subects, where users can find stories according to category. It is very easy to use.</li>
