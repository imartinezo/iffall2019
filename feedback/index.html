		Number 1:
		<br> -The rag is a little awkard here, since "Yandhi" is on its own line. 
		<br>-Unclear why "wanted" is the word you bolded as supposed to "Yandhi". 
		<br>-The placement of the text is very succesful in the desktop version.
		<br>-The text in the phone version is a little strange since only a small part of teh text is overlapping Kanye.
		<br><br>
		Number 2:
		<br>-This one is very succesful. The scale shift is very interesting.
		<br>-The treatment of the type is a little awkard in the desktop version. The first two lines are almost the same width, and then the last one is significantly smaller. The line spacing is also a bit strange. It seems like there is more space between the first two lines than the last two.
		<br><br>
		Number 3:
		<br>-The image placement is a bit off in the desktop version, since only a small sliver of his hand is visible. Either don't cut it out so much or cut the hand out completely. 
		<br>-It's a little too tight between "I'm my favorite" and his arms (desktop). 
		<br>-The placement of "Rapper" (desktop) is a bit strange because it is almost touching the image but not quite. Either overlap them or have them more seperated.
		<br>-The way you trated the image in the phone version is very succesful. The only problem with this version is that the text at the top is too close to edges and to the image.
